starbase-react is a production-ready Typescript, React, Redux Toolkit & Emotion boilerplate. Brewed with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) ([v5.0.1](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v5.0.1) w/ [TypeScript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)), then sweetened with:

- formatting via [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- linting via & [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- pre-commit linting and formatting via [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) & [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- a modern redux implementation via [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) & [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org)
- css-in-js with global styles and a theme via [Emotion](https://emotion.sh)
- ...and more!

starbase-react is a spin on [starbase](https://github.com/bstaruk/starbase). It's intended to be relatively small in scope so that it may be easily extended and customized, or used as a learning tool for folks who are trying to become familiar with Typescript, React 16, Redux Toolkit, Redux-Saga, Emotion, Testing Library, etc.
